# Natural-Events-Tracker
The aim of the project was to create an application that allows tracking of fires, storms, volcano eruptions, and other natural phenomena based on information from the NASA API. The application needed to provide the ability to generate a map with marked locations of events and to visualize the intensity of events in specific areas. The visualization of intensities was achieved by marking stronger events with larger dots and by connecting multiple dots together from events nearby. <br />
The API used in the project is located on the following website (version 3.0 was used): https://eonet.gsfc.nasa.gov. <br />
The application can be launched by executing the main.py file, which will initiate a GUI to guide the user.
